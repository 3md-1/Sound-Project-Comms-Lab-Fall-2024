## Concept
This project is a satirical audio project inspired by the book "The Castle" by Franz Kafka, with the core concept being the critique of the impersonal and indifferent nature of bureaucratic institutions. The theme centers on how procedures, formalities, and rigid protocols can affect not only empathy but also efficiency, sometimes making these assistance systems almost counterproductive. The project consists of a phone call between an injured caller and an unhelpful hospital call center, using exaggerated interactions and humorous exchanges to highlight the absurdity of the responses in a life threatening emergency. We designed this project with the listener’s engagement and immersion in mind, aiming to place them directly in the shoes of the caller dealing with unhelpful customer service. To evoke empathy and heighten the frustration felt by the caller, the audio uses immersive soundscapes, these include crash sounds, waiting music, and different voices that guide the listener through the ridiculousness of the call center interaction. This encourages the listener to feel the impatience, urgency, and humor in real-time, really amplifying the message.

## Features/Implementation Process


  - **Audio:**
    
In order to create the audio, we primarily relied on self-recorded sounds. Every bit of dialogue was recorded on a recording application that can be found on a smartphone. These audios were then processed using LogicProX. The top and bottom frequencies were equalized to provide them with the texture of a telephone call. These recordings were then processed through a noise reduction plugin, which eliminated unnecessary sounds. Additionally, in order to generate the automated audio heard at the beginning of the story, one of us recorded ourselves saying the lines, and they were, subsequently, processed through an online AI algorithm that changed the timbre of the speaker’s voice. Finally, we relied on some imported audios such as the sounds of the car crashes, the hold music, and the dialing noises from stock audio libraries such as the LogicProX loop library.

- **Visuals:**
  
The overall aesthetic and visuals were inspired by the 1990s anime style of Case Closed. To create visuals in this style, we utilised AI image generation tools as a starting point for producing initial images. However, we extensively edited these AI-generated images using Photoshop as they were not able to conceptualise the aesthetic in the way we envisioned – removing backgrounds, correcting blemishes, and refining details to align with the Case Closed aesthetic. Essentially we were able to create visuals that not only reflected the essence of 90s anime but also met the specific needs of the project, effectively combining AI assistance with our artistic skills for a polished final product.

- **Website:**
  
The development process for the website began with establishing the basic functionality and layout using HTML and CSS. Starting from scratch, the initial focus was on creating a clean structure that would allow users to follow the progression of the audio-driven story easily. In the early stages, we used placeholder stock images to experiment with object placement and overall visual hierarchy. This allowed for efficient testing and adjustment of where key interactive elements would best support the narrative. Once the basic layout was set, the next step was implementing audio-reactivity and visual cues to enhance user experience and interactivity. These visual cues not only reinforced the narrative but also helped lessen any confusion that might arise from the script’s humorous or abrupt tone shifts, ensuring users stay connected to the storyline.



## Reflection
When we first conceptualized this project, our primary goal was to create a satirical critique of bureaucratic inefficiency in customer service, specifically in the context of a hospital emergency call center. We wanted to highlight the frustrations of dealing with an impersonal, protocol-driven system while maintaining a humorous tone, and we can confidently say that these initial goals were met. 

However, this project did not come without it's challenges. The visuals presented a larger challenge than anticipated. While we began with the idea of using AI-generated images to quickly produce visuals in the 90s anime style of Case Closed, the results were not quite as expected. The AI tools provided a good starting point, but they fell short in capturing the fine details and aesthetic we were envisioning. This required us to invest additional time in editing the images in Photoshop, which, although time-consuming, allowed us to create a polished and cohesive visual style that aligned with the tone of the project.

In conclusion, while the process was not without its challenges, the final working version of the project met our expectations in several key ways. The combination of immersive sound, visuals, and a responsive website helped us create an engaging and humorous experience that successfully critiqued bureaucracy.
